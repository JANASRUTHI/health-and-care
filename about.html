                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p> A hospital is a place where a person goes to be healed when he 
                    or she is sick or injured. The difference between a 
                    hospital and other healthcare places like a clinic 
                    or a doctor's office is that a hospital will 
                    have beds where patients can stay overnight. These patients 
                    are called inpatients. The goal of inpatient treatment is 
                    to provide 24-7 medical stabilization, which is why this type 
                    of treatment has more of a hospital-like feel since patients 
                    are monitored by doctors, nurses, therapists, and social workers. 
                    Treatment is structured and has a schedule that can include individual 
                    therapy, group therapy, case management, and support groups.
